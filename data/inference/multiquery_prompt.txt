You are an assistant tasked with generating multiple versions of a user query to improve document retrieval.

Given the user's question:  
"{question}"  

Generate **two** additional rephrasings of this question.  

Ensure that the variations preserve the meaning but differ in phrasing.  

Format your output as a list, with each query on a new line.
