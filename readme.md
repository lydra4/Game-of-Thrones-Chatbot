## 🧠 Introduction

Welcome to my **Game of Thrones AI Chatbot**, powered by **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**.  
This project combines my passion for the _Game of Thrones_ universe with what I’ve learned during a recent AI Apprenticeship.

The goal?  
To build a **lore-accurate question-answering system** that understands the complex world of Westeros — from the Red Keep to the Wall.

---

## 📚 Dataset

The chatbot’s knowledge base consists of the following five books by George R. R. Martin:

- _A Game of Thrones_
- _A Clash of Kings_
- _A Storm of Swords_
- _A Feast for Crows_
- _A Dance with Dragons_

> ⚠️ **Note:** Due to copyright restrictions, I cannot provide the raw text files or links to the books.

## 🧩 How It Works: RAG Pipeline

RAG stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** — a framework that enhances LLMs by pairing them with external knowledge sources.

![RAG](images/classicalrag.png)

Here’s how the pipeline operates behind the scenes:

### 1. 🔧 Data Preparation

- The full book texts are **chunked** into overlapping sections.
- These chunks are converted into **dense embeddings** using a pre-trained model (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace).
- We store the chunks + metadata in a **FAISS** vector database for efficient similarity search.

### 2. 🔎 Query + Retrieval

- When a user submits a question (e.g., _"What happened at the Red Wedding?"_), it’s also embedded.
- The embedding is used to search the vector store and retrieve the top `k` most relevant passages.

### 3. 💬 Generation

- The **query + retrieved context** is injected into a prompt template.
- This template is passed to a **Large Language Model (LLM)** like GPT-4, Gemini, or Mixtral via LangChain.
- The model then generates an answer grounded in the books' content — not just general internet knowledge.

> 🔁 Supports both single-query and multi-query retrieval  
> 🔄 Reranking enabled via `ContextualCompressionRetriever`

## 🧪 Evaluation with RAGAS

I also implemented an **automated evaluation pipeline** using [RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas):

- ✅ **Faithfulness** – Is the answer backed by the retrieved context?
- ✅ **Answer Relevance** – Does the answer fully respond to the query?
- ✅ **Context Precision & Recall** – Are the retrieved documents relevant and sufficient?

Evaluations are reproducible and logged to **Langfuse**, enabling robust testing across LLMs, retrievers, and prompts.

## ✨ Example Queries

- _Who is Jon Snow's real mother?_
- _What are the three betrayals Daenerys was warned of?_
- _Describe the Red Wedding in detail._
- _What does the prophecy of Azor Ahai say?_

The chatbot provides **text-grounded answers**, referencing exact content from the books — not hallucinations.

conda env create -f .\gotchatbot-conda-env.yaml -y
conda activate got-chatbot
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r .\requirements.txt -r .\dev-requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `src/` directory and include your API keys:

```env

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python src/app.py
```

This will launch the Gradio interface at:

## 🧱 Docker Setup

To containerize and run the chatbot using Docker, follow these steps:

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before building the Docker image, ensure the following:

- Docker is installed on your system ([Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Your `.env` file (containing API keys and environment variables) exists under `src/.env`
- Able to run **bash script**:

  - **Linux/macOS:** Bash is usually pre-installed; you can run scripts directly in the terminal.
  - **Windows:**
    - Use **Git Bash** (install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)) to run bash scripts.
    - Alternatively, use **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** if installed.

### 📦 Build Docker Image

Run this command from the project root to build the image:

```bash
bash scripts/build_docker.sh
```

After building the image, run the below to spin up a docker container:

```bash
bash scripts/run_docker.sh
```
